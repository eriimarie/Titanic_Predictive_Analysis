# Titanic Data Dashboard (In Progress)

This project uses the Titanic dataset to build an interactive dashboard for data visualization and statistical analysis.  
It focuses on analyzing survival rates and the key factors that influenced outcomes such as age, gender, and passenger class.

The dashboard is being developed using **Tableau** and/or **Power BI**, and aims to:
- Visualize trends and survival patterns
- Highlight demographic insights
- Provide a clean, informative interface for exploring the data

> **Note:** This project is currently a work in progress and will be updated soon with additional features and visual improvements.
